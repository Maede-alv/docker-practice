# Project - Docker Backend, Frontend, DB, and Docker Compose

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up and run a **Dockerized** application with a **Backend**, **Frontend**, and **Database**, using **Docker Compose** for orchestration. It also shows how to push and pull Docker images to and from a **Nexus Repository**.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main components:
- **Backend**: A backend service running on a container (e.g., Python, Node.js, etc.).
- **Frontend**: A frontend service built with React or another framework.
- **Database**: A service to run a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
- **Docker Compose**: Used to manage multiple Docker containers for the backend, frontend, and database services.
